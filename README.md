## Overview
Pneumonia is an infection in the Lungs caused by microbes. The most common causes are due to virus and bacteria that manage to evade the human bodyâ€™s defense mechanisms and colonize the Bronchioles or Alveoli. This results in inflammation that causes the lungs to fill up with fluids, which makes it hard to breath. According to the to the Center for Desease Control (CDC) about 50,000 people die from pneumonia each year in the United States. The mortality rate for patients with a severe cases of the pnemonia is up to 30%.
